Philips Hue demo at TEDx Trento 2014, changing colour based on Tweets and user Smartphone movements.

The demo consists of:

	* A Philip Hue Lamp that changes color randomly when users Tweet using a special hashtag
	* A Phlip Hue Lamp that changes color based on user's smartphone movement
	* A HTML5 webpage that detects the smartphone device orientation, displays the data, and generates a random HTML color code for controlling the light 
	* A [Node-RED] flow that runs on a RaspberryPi and monitors the Twitter feeds, and receives the color codes generated from the smarthpone

To avoid any firewall-port blocking issues, the color code generated by the webpage is transmitted to the Philips Hue bridge through a RaspberryPi and a MQTT broker. 

This is the code that implements:

	* A webpage (index.php) that detects smarthone orientation and delivers a random color to a Philips Hue lamp
	* The script (magiclight.php) that acts as a MQTT client for delivering the random color from the webpage to the Philips Hue lamp
	* The [Node-RED] flow that receives color codes through MQTT and sends it to the Philips Hue bridge (using a Node-RED node for the Hue)


### Requirements

* A Web Server to host the smartphone webpage (index.php), and the MQTT client schipt (magiclight.php), PHP > v4
* A RaspberryPi (or a computer) with Internet connection (to fetch Tweets) being in the same netwotk with the Philips Hue Bridge
* [Node-RED] installation with the Philips Hue node (install [node-red-nodes])
